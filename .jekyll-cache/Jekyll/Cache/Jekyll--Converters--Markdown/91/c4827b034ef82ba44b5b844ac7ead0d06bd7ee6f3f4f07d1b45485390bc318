I"i<p>Since moving to Seattle a month ago, a lot of the questions I get from my friends and family have been about my apartment. When I decided to move to Seattle without a job lined up, one of the reasons I felt confident that I would be able to afford the move was because I knew the city was allowing developers to build affordable micro-studio apartments.</p>
