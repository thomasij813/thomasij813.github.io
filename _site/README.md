This repository contains the contents and layout for Thomas Johnson's blog. It uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) to generate pages. [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) was employed to facilitate initial setup.

To build this site, I followed [this post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole) from [Joshua Lande's](http://joshualande.com) blog as a guide. You can see that the layout and style of my own blog was heavily inspired by the clean simplicity of his.
