I'm a recent Seattle transplant, originally hailing from that super sunny and unapologetically weird state we know as Florida.

My passions include front-end web development, UX design, and data visualization and analysis.

I also happen to know a lot about Marxist literary theory and Victorian literature. That's right, I'm also one of [*those*](http://fyeahenglishmajorarmadillo.tumblr.com/) people...
