title: About
---

I'm a recent Seattle transplant, originally hailing from that super sunny and unapologetically weird state we know as Florida.

My passions include front-end web development, UX design, data visualization and analysis, and the application of 20th-century Marxist and Psychoanalytic literary theory to Victorian literature?

That's right, I have a B.A. in English. I'm one of *those* people...
